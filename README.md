# SwPortal

This project is a rewrite of https://starwars-visualguide.com  
Original project was written in AngularJs (Angular version 1) and my uses Angular version 8.  
I'm rewriting this to learn full stack Spring + Angular web development and I didn't want to design the UI as I started as backend dev :D 

# Running
To run the project backend server should be run first. Backend is available at repo https://github.com/damianw345/sw-portal-backend

After running backend it's enough to run `ng s -o` at project root dir and app will open at http://localhost:4200
